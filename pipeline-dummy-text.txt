# This is a workaround so that the github actions pipeline of this repo which should update docker image tags does not fail
# if the image tags are already up-to-date before the pipeline was started.
# The pipeline just adds a string to this file so that "git commit" does not throw an error due to "nothing to commit."
# This is especially necessary as there is another pipeline that runs the integration tests which is triggered by a change in the repo.
